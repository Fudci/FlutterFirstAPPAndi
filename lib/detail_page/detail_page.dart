She is unable to utter a word or sound in her daily life due to her crippling anxiety and fear of rejection by her peers. However, she dreams of overcoming this adversity and desires to build friendly relationships with others and make 100 friends. The first person in her school to realize she had an inability to communicate well was her fellow classmate Tadano Hitohito. Tadano decided to help her overcome her anxiety and make her dream of 100 friends a reality. He became her first friend and with his help, Shouko now attempts to socialize with and befriend the other students of her class. Shouko hardly talks with people. If she is forced to speak, she trembles like a vibrating phone. She usually carries a notebook and writing utensils to communicate with her friends. However, when she forgets them, she freezes up.",
